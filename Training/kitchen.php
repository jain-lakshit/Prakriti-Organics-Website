                <h3>Kitchen Garden Project</h3>
                <p>
                    Kitchen garden project - Your contribution for your family's health and ecology begins in your backyard , and trust us when we say it will have an impact that you cannot even imagine.
                    While most people shy away from gardening thinking that it needs a lot of space in the house, it's a myth. You just need proper planning, designing/developing and knowledge to grow vegetables at your doorsteps. <br>
                   <br> Objectives -
                    <br>1.	Through this project we aim at promoting the daily use of organically grown vegetables and herbs in common households , this will help in covering up malnutrition and micronutrient deficiency that is being caused by harmful chemical based fertilizers, pesticide & weedicide riddled food products. You can easily put green compost, waste from the kitchen, & neem based natural pest removers, netting etc. instead of chemicals.....<br>
                    <br>2.	Growing different types of herbs and vegetables around homes and schools will give children a first hand experience of gardening that can turn into a lifelong skill that will continue to benefit them all along.<br>
                    <br>3.	Conservation of our environment and ecosystem is yet another objective we are aiming  at through this project , it is becoming increasingly clear and visible that human activities are causing unthinkable harm to our planet and if remedial steps are not taken in time , it might be  end of road for us all , hence any contribution be it big or small is more necessary now than ever.<br>
